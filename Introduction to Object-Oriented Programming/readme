Below is a comprehensive collection of 100 coding exercises and 25 multiple‑choice quiz questions focused about an Introduction to Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. These exercises cover:
Understanding Classes and Objects
Defining a Class and Creating Objects
Instance Attributes and Methods
Class Attributes and Methods
Inheritance and Polymorphism Basics
Each exercise includes complete Python code and an explanation of what the code does. At the end, you’ll find 25 multiple‑choice questions with full answer explanations.

What You Will Learn
Classes and Objects: Understand the core concept of OOP by defining classes and creating instances (objects).
Instance Attributes and Methods: Learn how to store data in objects and define behavior unique to each instance.
Class Attributes and Methods: Discover how to share data and behavior across all instances of a class.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Get introduced to code reuse and overriding methods for more flexible designs.

Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you will be able to:
Define your own classes in Python.
Create and manipulate objects (instances of classes).
Use instance attributes to store individual object data.
Define and call instance methods to perform object‑specific operations.
Create class attributes and class methods to share data across objects.
Implement inheritance to extend and modify existing classes.
Understand the basics of polymorphism, where different classes share the same method names with different implementations.
