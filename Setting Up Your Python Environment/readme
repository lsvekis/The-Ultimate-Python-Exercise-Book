Setting Up Your Python Environment
Introduction
In this section you will learn to:
Install Python on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Verify your Python installation by checking version information, module locations, and environment details.
Use the Python interactive shell for quick testing, arithmetic, variable inspection, and debugging.
Set up and use various code editors such as IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook.
Run Python scripts from the command line and learn to work with command-line arguments.
Understand the structure of a Python script (e.g., using the if __name__ == "__main__": idiom) and best practices like virtual environments, logging, and code formatting.

Learning Objectives
By working through these exercises and quiz questions, you will be able to:
Install and verify Python on different platforms.
Use Python’s built-in modules (such as sys, os, platform, and argparse) to inspect your environment.
Practice coding in the interactive shell and see immediate feedback.
Write scripts using modern Python features (f‑strings, list comprehensions, exception handling, etc.).
Configure and use IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook to write, run, and debug your Python code.
Parse command‑line arguments and work with files and JSON data.
Understand how to integrate best practices (debugging, virtual environments, linters) into your workflow.
