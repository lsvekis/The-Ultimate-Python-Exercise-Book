Below is a comprehensive collection of 100 coding exercises and 25 multiple‑choice quiz questions focused on Working with Data – Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries in Python. This section covers:
Lists: How to create them, index and slice, and perform various manipulations
Tuples: Immutable sequences and when to use them
Dictionaries: Key–value pairs, adding and removing items, and common operations
Iteration: How to loop through lists, tuples, and dictionaries

What You Will Learn
By working through these exercises you will learn to:
Create and manipulate lists, including indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, and removing items.
Understand tuples as immutable sequences and use them appropriately.
Work with dictionaries to store, retrieve, update, and delete key–value pairs.
Use built‑in methods and functions for each data structure.
Iterate through these data structures using loops.

Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you should be able to:
Create, access, and modify lists.
Understand the immutable nature of tuples and how to use them.
Create and update dictionaries, and perform common dictionary operations.
Loop through lists, tuples, and dictionaries using for loops.
Solve practical problems using these common data structures.
