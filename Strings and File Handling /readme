Below is a comprehensive collection of 100 coding exercises and 25 multiple‑choice quiz questions covering the topics in Strings and File Handling. In these exercises you will work with:
Strings: Basic operations, indexing, slicing, methods, and formatting
File Handling: Reading from and writing to text files, and working with CSV files using Python’s built‑in functions and the csv module

What You Will Learn
String Basics: How to create, index, slice, and manipulate strings.
String Methods: Use methods such as upper(), lower(), split(), join(), and more to process text.
String Formatting: Format strings using f‑strings, the .format() method, and the % operator.
File Handling: Open, read, and write text files, manage file encodings, and work with files safely using the with statement.
Working with CSV Files: Read from and write to CSV files using Python’s csv module, including working with dictionaries and custom delimiters.

Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you should be able to:
Create and manipulate strings, using indexing, slicing, and built‑in methods.
Format strings in several ways to produce well‑formatted output.
Read from and write to files safely and efficiently.
Process CSV files by reading rows, writing rows, and converting between data structures.
