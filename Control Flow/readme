Below is a comprehensive set of 100 coding exercises and 25 multiple‑choice quiz questions focused on Control Flow – Conditionals and Loops in Python. These exercises cover:
Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
Logical operators (and, or, not)
Loops (both for and while)
The break and continue statements
Practical examples that combine loops and conditionals
Each exercise includes the complete code (or instructions to simulate user input) along with detailed explanations. In addition, you’ll find 25 multiple‑choice questions with answer explanations to test your understanding.

What You Will Learn
How to use conditional statements to control the flow of your program.
How to combine conditions using logical operators.
How to iterate over data using for loops and while loops.
How to alter loop behavior with break and continue.
How to build practical applications using loops and conditionals.

Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you should be able to:
Write and structure Python code that makes decisions using if, elif, and else.
Combine multiple conditions with and, or, and not to form complex logic.
Use loops (for and while) to iterate over data and perform repetitive tasks.
Employ break and continue to manage loop execution.
Solve practical problems (e.g., number guessing, FizzBuzz, prime number checks) using control flow.
