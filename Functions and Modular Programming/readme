Below is a comprehensive set of 100 coding exercises and 25 multiple‑choice quiz questions focused on Functions and Modular Programming in Python. This section covers:
Defining and calling functions
Function parameters and return values
Default parameters and keyword arguments
Scope and lifetime of variables
Importing and using modules (such as math, random, and your own custom modules)

What You Will Learn
By working through these exercises you will learn to:
Define and call functions: Create reusable blocks of code and invoke them from other parts of your program.
Use function parameters and return values: Pass data into functions and return computed results.
Apply default parameters and keyword arguments: Write functions with default values and call them using keywords.
Understand variable scope and lifetime: Distinguish between local and global variables and how their lifetimes are managed.
Import and use modules: Leverage standard modules (like math and random) and create/use custom modules to modularize your code.

Learning Objectives
After completing these exercises, you should be able to:
Write and invoke functions with various types of parameters.
Design functions that return values and even multiple values.
Use default arguments and keyword arguments to make your functions flexible.
Understand and control the scope of variables (local, global, nonlocal).
Import standard libraries and custom modules to extend your program’s functionality.
